An active archive of computer art.

This project aims to resurrect forgotten works of computer art and port them to a language that is widely used, easily accessibly to beginners, and advanced enough to build upon the original artworks to create new ones. For these reasons, we have chosen Processing as the common language for this project due to its widespread use (particularly in educational environments), extensive documentation, and active community of developers and contributors.   

Our current focus is on translating works found in issues of "Computer Graphics and Art" 1976-1978. PDFs of the original documents can be found in the "Downloads" section of this repo or on our site.

HOW TO SUBMIT A TRANSLATION
--------------------  
If you would rather not use GitHub to submit your work, please just create a zip file of your work and send it to us via email: info@recodeproject.com

If you would like to contribute via GitHub, follow these steps:  

1.  Go to the website and pick one out you want to translate.

2.	Decide if you want to do a direct translation (the end result looks just like the original) or an experimental translation (it does something different). 

3.  Open up Processing and go nuts.

4.	Fork this repo and clone it to your machine. 

5.	Add a folder with your name like this: firstName_lastName (all lower case). Put your project folder(s) in that folder. For example: firstName_lastName > myTranslation > myTranslation.pde.

5.	Do NOT include images in your folders.

6.	Send a pull request. In the notes, please include the URL to the original piece on our site and what category your translation is in (direct translation or experimental).

We will merge your request, run the code and take a screenshot and upload your translation to our site. If the translation requires a video, we'll do that for you too.

If you want to make any changes to your translation or remove it, please email us (info@recodeproject.com)

Q: Why aren't you using Processing.js?  
A: Processing.js doesn't include all the functions available in regular Processing. We would like people to have access to all of those beautiful functions. If, however, you prefer to make something that can run in a browser we welcome that and will do our best to make it look right on our site.
